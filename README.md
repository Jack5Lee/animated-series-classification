# Classifying Genre of Animated Series Based on Promotional Material

Classifying genres of movies based on their posters is a common problem in deep learning. We decided to tackle a similar problem but with animated media instead. This project aims to classify genres of anime by analyzing their posters using convolutional neural networks. We developed and compared five different models to determine the most effective approach for genre classification. This project not only helps in understanding the visual patterns associated with different anime genres but also can enhance a variety of recommendation systems by providing accurate genre tagging. The following below gives a high-level overview of the project, but details such as methodology and results are covered in the **Animated Series Genre Classification** .pdf report.

## Dataset

We used a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset/) from 2023 consisting of 24,905 posters. Each poster has an id, name (in original language), English name, other name, rating of anime, genres of the anime, synopsis, type (movie or tv series), number of episodes, and date aired.
